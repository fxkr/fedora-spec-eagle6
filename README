Instructions for packaging Cadsoft Eagle 6 for Fedora 20/21:

    mkdir -p build/SOURCES
    spectool -g -C build/SOURCES eagle6.spec
    cp eagle6{,.desktop,.spec} build/SOURCES
    rpmbuild --define "_topdir $(realpath build)" -ba eagle6.spec

Then  you can install the package with:

    sudo yum localinstall build/RPMS/x86_64/eagle6-6.6.0-1.fc*.x86_64.rpm

Note: I named the package "eagle6" because while Eagle 6 is the
version I need, it isn't the most recent version anymore since
Cadsoft has already released Eagle 7.

I wish there was an AUR equivalent for Fedora.
